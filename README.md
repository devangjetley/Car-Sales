### Project Overview
This project was completed in collaboration with AutoTrend Dealerships Pvt. Ltd., a leading car dealership in India specializing in the sale and servicing of passenger and commercial vehicles. The primary objective was to analyze car sales data to identify key drivers behind customer purchases, enabling the dealership to optimize inventory, target the right customer segments, and ultimately increase sales.

## Key areas of analysis included:

Best-selling brands, fuel types, and price ranges

Customer demographics (age, gender, region)

Preferred vehicle features (safety ratings, mileage)

## Data Grouping Approach:

Age Groups: Young (<30), Middle (31–45), Seniors (>45)

Fuel Types: Petrol, Diesel, Electric

Price Ranges: Low (<10 lakhs), Middle (10–20 lakhs), High (>20 lakhs)

## Key Findings:

SUVs are the top sellers (57%), with Petrol cars also leading (57%)

Maruti (27%) and Hyundai (24%) are the most popular brands

Middle-aged buyers (31–45) account for 65% of sales

Most buyers prefer cars in the middle price range (51%)

Urban areas lead in sales (38%)

Cars with mid-level safety ratings (4–4.5 stars) are chosen by 68% of buyers

Electric cars, especially Tata Nexon, are gaining traction in Urban regions

### Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, the following actionable recommendations were provided to AutoTrend Dealerships:

Inventory Optimization

Stock more SUVs and Electric vehicles (e.g., Tata Nexon), particularly for Urban and South regions

Maintain a healthy inventory of Petrol and Diesel models to meet ongoing demand

Targeted Marketing

Focus marketing campaigns on the 31–45 age group, but ensure messaging appeals to both genders

Promote Hatchbacks in the North and offer special discounts on Sedans to stimulate sales

Feature Highlighting

Emphasize cars with mid-range safety ratings and mileage, as these are highly preferred by customers

Electric Vehicle Strategy

Educate Urban customers about the benefits of Electric vehicles

Collaborate with charging station providers to enhance EV adoption

### Projected Impact:
These strategies are expected to boost sales by 15% by closely aligning inventory and marketing with customer preferences.
